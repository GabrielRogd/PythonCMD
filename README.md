# PythonCMD
A Python-based command prompt concept which includes windows command emulation.

Current features:
- echo: Input your message and it will be clearly outputted in Python
- windows (CMD Mode): Emulate Windows commands that you would normally write in a Windows CMD (Requires Windows host)
- python: Switch to a Python CLI environment so you can execute Python commands freely (In case of any syntax error, PythonCMD has a failsafe in place and will not crash but will instead output syntax error)
- speedtest: Test your internet connection (requires speedtest-cli library)
- cls / clear - Clear Python shell (only works on Python shell running on Windows)

This project is at an early stage, meaning that soonly more features will be added!

Tested in Python 3.12.
